## Course Description

This repository is a collection of projects in a graduate-level industrial engineering course, INDE 577: Data Science and Machine Learning, of Rice University in Fall 2022. This course focuses on the topics in data science and machine learning algorithms and python-based applications. The key feature of this course is that instead of using well-established packages, we build up algorithms from scratch. In this process, we understood the intuition behind the algorithms including basic concepts, computational steps, model design, and evaluation metrics. 

Machine learning is the science of understanding and building methods to *learn from data*, i.e. methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is useful for simplifying problems where existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules, finding solutions to complex problems, fluctuating environments that require adaptation to new data, and managing large amounts of data.

Some applications of machine learning:
- create means of interaction: chatbot natural language processing, image recognition, and speech recognition so apps can react to voice commands
- personalizing experiences: personalized recommendations, search results, notifications, and customized ads targeting
- identify anomalies: detecting credit fraud, spam, fake news, and tumors
- provide insights: understanding different ways analytics can be grouped and evaluating features, summarizing documents
- prepare content: making predictions about future behavior to preload content and reduce wait times, representing high-dimensional data in a clear diagram, or forecasting revenue

This course uses the following data science tools:
- Python version 3.6 or higher
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
  - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/all_symbols)

The topics covered in this course broadly fall into 3 categories:

## Repository Description

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and implements algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.

Files in this repository are Jupyter Notebook projects demonstrating machine learning algorithms learned in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository primarily contains supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.
The following topics have been covered in class:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis]() using the primary dataset used in this repository
- [Supervised Learning]()
  - [Perceptron]()
  - [Linear Regression]()
  - [Gradient Descent]()
  - [Logistic Regression]()
  - [Neural Networks]()
  - [K Nearest Neighbors]()
  - [Naive Bayes Classifier]()
  - [Support Vector Machines]()
  - [Decision/Regression Trees]()
  - [Ensemble Learning]()
- [Unsupervised Learning]()
  - [K-Means Clustering]()
  - [Principle Component Analysis]()
- [Reinforcement Learning]()
  - [Q-Learning algorithm]()
  - [Graph Theory]() - this is not an explicit "algorithm" of reinforcement learning. Rather, this is an area of new development and overlap between a mathematical field and data science

<!-- The examples and implementations of algorithms in this repository will specifically focus on the context of Human Resources Analytics, which is a growing area in business representing the use of data science and machine learning in the context of Human Resources.
